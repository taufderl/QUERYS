This Question Answering System processes questions given in natural language 
referring to the subject Countries. 
It uses the Stanford coreNLP to extract the essential content of the question,
 maps it to the appropriate DBpedia relations and retrieves the answer from DBpedia using SPARQL. 
 It has been designed by two students at the University of Groningen as final project of 
 the course 'Semantic Web Technology'
